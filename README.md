Grid designed for interaction by multiple users.

Our goal is to create a cohesive application that explores the abstract interaction between user interfaces.
The experiment is run with two blind variables:
1. You do not know who the other people are (unless you troll together).
2. You do not know how many other people there are (if sample sizes are large enough).

The way we will carry this out is by creating a screen filled with 16x16 squares and starting with a blank webpage.
Squares can be cycled between "n" amount of colors by clicking... {1,2,3...n}
Default color should be neutral (preferably black or white)
Through updating the color in each square using node.js we wish to save the file as an ongoing project.
Eventually screenshots will be taken every minute for a whole month, then .gif or .mp4's can be produced with video images over an entire month. This will create interactive videos and can be coupled with statistics such as how many concurrent users over a period exist, etc.

We wish to target a mainstream audience that desires to little more than screw around and click. You may love to make pixel art, you may love to troll, you may love to click every damn square. Do what you want. We want your love. Interaction drives this application known as "pro-grid", and while applications like this exist, this would be pointed for the most ephermeral level of computer users, "active users".

Possible adaptations:
Invert Command - Simply flip the colors of each square with a press of a button (or a hidden hotkey would be sweet)
Randomized Square Real Estate - Each user gets z% of the grid and is distributed randomly for control. Refreshing would change the seed but this would promote more random art and less totalitarian trolling
Image buffering - Upload a 16x16 image and be able to place it into squares for all to see.
3D Implementation - Each cube is represented by a 16x16x16 space and has lighting/rendering effects. Videos can be produced of renders from multiple perspective angles.
N - ability to change number of colors and specific colors to mix things up
